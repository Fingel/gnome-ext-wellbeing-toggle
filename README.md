# gnome-ext-wellbeing-toggle
Toggle wellbeing reminders on/off easily from the GNOME quick settings menu.

The GNOME wellbeing features are great but then can get really annoying during meetings
or other activities where getting up from your computer to do some squats isn't really an
option. There is the built in "delay" feature but it seems to way too short, like 30 seconds?

This extension just makes it easier to toggle the notifications on/off without going
into settings.
